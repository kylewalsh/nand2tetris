Given that the DFF was provided, most of these were pretty straight-forward. Once you figured out how a binary register worked, then a 16-bit one wasn't so bad. 
Then a RAM unit just uses a demultiplexer to pick the address and a multiplexer to unify the output.
Each progressive RAM was just moving up the significant bits as the driver for a different demultiplexor.
I needed some help from the forums to see the correlation between the Binary Memory Cell and the PC chip.
